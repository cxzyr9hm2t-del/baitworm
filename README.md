# 🎣 Three Cast Baits

### Handcrafted Soft Plastics — Kingston, Ontario

> **Born on the Rock. Built for the Water.**
>
> ---
>
> ## Our Story
>
> **Three Cast Baits** is a handcrafted soft plastic bait company founded by three brothers from **St. John's, Newfoundland**, now based in **Kingston, Ontario**. Every bait is designed, poured, and inspected by hand in Darryl's garage — no factory lines, no automation.
>
> We grew up jigging cod off the wharf and casting for trout around Signal Hill. When life brought us to Kingston, we found world-class freshwater fishing but couldn't find soft baits that met our standards. So we cleared out Darryl's garage and started pouring our own.
>
> **If it doesn't fish, it doesn't ship.**
